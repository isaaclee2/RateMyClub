				Welcome to RateMyClub USC! By accessing or using our website (the "Service"), you agree to
				comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions ("Terms"). Please read these
				Terms carefully before using our Service.
			</p>

			<h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
			<p>
				RateMyClub USC is a platform where USC community members can rate and review student clubs
				and organizations to provide valuable information to others. Users must sign in with their
				USC email (@usc.edu) for verification to write reviews.
			</p>

			<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
			<p>
				To write reviews, you must have a valid USC email address (@usc.edu). This includes current
				students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Anyone can browse and read reviews without signing in.
				By using this Service, you confirm that you are authorized to use your USC email address.
			</p>

			<h2>3. User-Generated Content and Review Guidelines</h2>
			<p>
				Users are solely responsible for the content they submit. All reviews must comply with our
				guidelines:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Honest and authentic:</strong> Reviews must be based on genuine experience with the
					club. Fake reviews, reviews intended solely to boost or harm ratings, and reviews by individuals
					with no connection to the club are prohibited.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Appropriate content:</strong> No hate speech, harassment, profanity, sexually explicit
					content, or otherwise inappropriate material.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Personal mentions:</strong> You may mention specific individuals only when providing
					honest feedback based on genuine interactions. Content intended solely to defame individuals
					is prohibited.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Board member disclosure:</strong> If you are a board member or officer of the club
					you are reviewing, you must disclose this relationship.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				All reviews are pre-moderated and must be approved before publication, typically within a
				couple of days. We reserve the right to reject or remove any content that violates these
				guidelines.
			</p>

			<h2>4. Platform Disclaimer</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>RateMyClub USC is a platform for sharing student opinions and experiences.</strong> Reviews
				represent individual user experiences and opinions, not factual statements or official positions.
				We do not endorse, verify, or take responsibility for the accuracy of user-generated content.
				The presence of negative reviews does not constitute defamation by RateMyClub USC - we simply
				provide a platform for students to share their honest experiences.
			</p>

			<h2>5. Account Termination</h2>
			<p>
				We reserve the right to suspend or terminate user accounts that violate these Terms,
				including but not limited to:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Submitting fake or dishonest reviews</li>
				<li>Deliberately defaming individuals or organizations</li>
				<li>Repeated violations of content guidelines</li>
				<li>Fraudulent activity or misuse of the Service</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Termination may occur without prior notice.</p>

			<h2>6. Content Modification and Deletion</h2>
			<p>
				Users may request deletion of their reviews by contacting us at ratemyclubusc@gmail.com. We
				reserve the right to modify or remove any user-generated content at our discretion to ensure
				compliance with these Terms.
			</p>

				RateMyClub USC respects user privacy. We collect minimal personal information as outlined in
				our Privacy Policy. By using the Service, you agree to our Privacy Policy.
			</p>

				<li>Actions taken based on information found on the platform</li>
				<li>Any disputes between users and clubs or organizations</li>

				with an updated revision date. Your continued use of the Service after changes are made
				constitutes acceptance of the modified Terms.
